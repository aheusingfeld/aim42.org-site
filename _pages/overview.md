aim42 is the systematic and pragmatic approach to improve productive software systems and architectures.  aim42 works iteratively in three phases (analyze, evaluate, improve) supported by crosscutting activities. For each phase, aim42 proposes a number of proven and established practices and patterns. The method addresses both business and technical stakeholders of software systems.  As aim42  is based upon a small number of core concepts, it is easy to understand.  aim42 does not required tool support and is therefore completely vendor-agnostic.

aim42 is developed by an active community in open-source style, backed by extensive industrial experience and scientific research. It has proven to work under time and budget constraints in various industries.
