    excerpt: 'aim42 works iteratively in three phases (analyze, evaluate, improve) supported by crosscutting activities. For each phase, aim42 proposes a number of proven and established practices and patterns. aim42 is **free and open-source**, completely **vendor-agnostic** and does not require any specific tool. '

        excerpt: 'Estimate the **value** of issues (how serious they
        might be) and the required **effort** for potential improvements.
